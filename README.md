# **This is the testing branch of my React App**
## Going to be posting the rest and blocking some files soon
  - Downloading this repo will not work as there is css that is ignored by .gitignore because of liscensing
  
# First Ever Real React Application made

  - Yes there is some spahghetti code in this and A LOT of nooby habits in this repo but this does show how far I have learned in terms in best practices for React and getting going 
  - A better showcase of my current React skills would be my current portfolio site and the rho pro application 
  - This is my first site done for a client so I do have actual work experience as a freelancer
